# DriverFatigueAlert
This project is a mobile application for android that analyzes the eye opening value of the driver and gives a warning at the time of fatigue. Aperture values were found using ML Kit libraries.

## Real Time
This application does not analyze a photo or video. It allows you to analyze your image in real time.
## High Accuracy
Thanks to the ML Kit Library, the aperture values of the eyes are determined with high accuracy.
## Quick Analysis
The aperture values of the eye are calculated quickly and the necessary warning is given.
